							<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Early Life and Career</h3>
							<p>Neeraj Chopra is an Indian track and field athlete who competes in the javelin through event.
A Junior Commissioned Officer(JCO) in the Indian Army, Chopra i the first track
and field athlete to win a gold medal for India at the Olympics.
After local children teased him about his childhood obesity,Chopra's father enrolled him in a gymnasium
at Madlauda; he was later enrolled in a gym in Panipat. While there, he also visited the near by panipat 
Sports Authority of India(SAI)centre, where javelin thrower Jaiveer Choudhary recognied his early talent
in the winter of 2010. Observing Chopra's ability to achive a 40-metre throw without training and 
impressed his drive, Choudgary became his first coach.
After training under Choudhary for a year, the 13-year-old Chopra was admitted to the 
Tau Devi Lal Sorts Complex in Panchkula, 4 hours from his Home.
The sports Complex was then one of only two facilities in the state of Haryana with a synthetic runway.
There, he trained under coach Naseem Ahmad, who made him train in long-distance running along with Javelin throw.
while initially at Tau Devi, he typically achieved throws off around 55metres.</p>
